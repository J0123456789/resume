# Azure Cloud Resume
I had stumbled across the Cloud Resume Challenge (https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and thought this this would a fun challenge and definitely a challenge it was!

Feel free to check out my site at https://jefflo.me

The challenge included:

- Creating a resume written in HTML and styled with CSS.

- Deploying the resume online as an Azure Stroage static website securely through https utilizing Azure CDN while pointing to a custom domain name to the Azure CDN endpoint.

- Creating a visitor counter on the resume page using Javascript.

- Utilizing Azure CosmosDB to retrieve and udpate the counter.

- Creating an API using Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger written in Python.

- Test the Python code and Azure Function

- Using Source control

- Create CI/CD Pipeline for both the backend and frontend

The tools I used for this were:
- VSCode
- Python
- HTML/CSS
